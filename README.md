  Baseball Dynasty Simulator is designed for an in-depth, yet fun and casual experience.<br />
  Many baseball simulators I've tried in the past fall into one of two camps: way too complicated or way too simple.<br />
</p>
<p>
  With this simulator, my goal is to bridge that gap, and appeal to players like myself, who<br />
  like diving deep into statistics and having a lot of control, but are tired of bad UIs<br />
  and focusing too much on the numbers. We like sabermetrics, but realize the game<br />
  is played on the field, not in a spreadsheet.
</p>
<p>
  By introducing new stats and features such as "Cut of Jib Index", "Grit", "Malaise Watch", and "Baseball-y Plays",<br />
  and taking into account a player's origin story (hometown, school attended, draft history, etc.),<br />
  I think this simulator can provide a unique experience that most closely resembles how the game is played in real life.

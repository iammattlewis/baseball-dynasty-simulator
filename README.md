  Baseball Dynasty Simulator is designed for an in-depth, yet fun and casual experience.
  Many baseball simulators I've tried in the past fall into one of two camps: way too complicated or way too simple.

  With this simulator, my goal is to bridge that gap, and appeal to players like myself, who
  like diving deep into statistics and having a lot of control, but are tired of bad UIs
  and focusing too much on the numbers. We like sabermetrics, but realize the game
  is played on the field, not in a spreadsheet.

  By introducing new stats and features such as "Cut of Jib Index", "Grit", "Malaise Watch", and "Baseball-y Plays",
  and taking into account a player's origin story (hometown, school attended, draft history, etc.),
  I think this simulator can provide a unique experience that most closely resembles how the game is played in real life.

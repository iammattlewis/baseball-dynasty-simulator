    Baseball Dynasty Simulator is designed for an in-depth, yet fun and casual experience.<br />
    <br />
    Many baseball simulators I've tried in the past fall into one of two camps: way too complicated or way too simple.<br />
    With this simulator, my goal is to bridge that gap, and appeal to players like myself, who like diving deep into statistics <br />
    and having a lot of control, but are tired of bad UIs and focusing too much on the numbers.<br />
    <br />
    We like sabermetrics, but realize the game is played on the field, not in a spreadsheet. By introducing new stats and features such as<br /> 
    "Cut of Jib Index", "Grit", "Malaise Watch", and "Baseball-y Plays",
    and taking into account a player's origin story (hometown, school attended, draft history, etc.),<br /> 
    I think this simulator can provide a unique experience that most closely resembles how the game is played in real life.
